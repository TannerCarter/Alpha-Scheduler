# The Alpha Scheduler

# Version 1

# Description

In this challenge we had to use the given html and css; create a scheduler with comments, or descriptions based on the hour of the day. In addition to this we needed to use moment to capture the current day in - realtime - and use moment to showcase whether the current time is past, present, or future in - realtime. This was actually a fun project to work on, compared to the last couple of weeks, this one wasn't as stressful as we were able to cut out a lot of work using bootstrap, jquery, and moment (Third Party APIs). Although I say this was fun, it required me to really grasp how to use all three of the forementioned <scripts> and or <links> that were given on this project.

# Tasks

- Given a scheduler, the scheduler as the current realtime date at the top of the schedule.
- Per the schedule, this will showcase hours throughout the day.
- Per the hours on the schedule, show whether the hours are past, present, or future in grey, orangish red, and green - respectfully.
- When you enter a description for the hours throughout the day, the description is saved locally and will persist even if the page is refreshed.
